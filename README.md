# WhatsUpDoc
Documentation tool for EScript based projects (e.g., PADrend)

Uses libclang to parse the init hierarchy of EScript Wrapper classes written in C++.

### Why WhatsUpDoc?

EScript comes from HasE-Script (german for rabbit); and what's the catchphrase of one of the most famous bunnies?

It was developed since doxygen lacks the capabilities to correctly parse the init hierarchy usually used for EScript.
